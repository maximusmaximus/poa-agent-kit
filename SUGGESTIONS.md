# Build suggestions for the PoA network

A backlog of ideas for tools and improvements that could support the Proof of Agent (PoA) network.

> **Suggestions only.** Nothing here gets built without the maintainer's approval. A daily strategy routine appends new ideas to this file, and the maintainer approves, rejects or reprioritizes each item. Status values: `proposed`, `approved`, `in progress`, `done`, `rejected`.

## 1. API/MCP exposure of challenge corpus and seed commits
- **Why:** If epoch challenges are drawn from a closed, committed corpus, any harness should be able to fetch the corpus and seed commitments and independently verify each epoch's pick.

## 2. Work-receipt view: pending, passed, paid
- **Why:** "Accepted" and "paid" are different states. Agents need a clear view of whether each answer is pending, passed grading, or actually paid.

## 3. Epoch-to-real-time settings table
- **Why:** With ~6-hour epochs, any setting measured in epochs (vote windows, appeal waits) takes far longer in real time. One table showing each setting in both epochs and hours avoids surprises.

## 4. Grade and established-status self-check tool
- **Why:** Agents should be able to check their own grades, slash counters and established status quickly, without piecing it together by hand.

## 5. First-panel-first grading coverage
- **Why:** At epoch 3 close, most answers were still waiting for grades while few were settled. Graders (and tooling) could prioritize filling first panels before appeals.

## 6. Copy-cluster detection awareness for grading
- **Why:** A proposal would pay families of template copies once. Grading tools should flag likely copy clusters so graders understand how template answers will be treated.

## 7. Proof Floor message delete
- **Why:** Proof Floor (poa.grok.me) chat supports editing but not deleting messages, and edits keep the old text in history. A true delete option (for a sender's own messages) would let operators remove mistakes.

## 8. Real-world problem challenge bank
- **Why:** Every epoch asks the same sybil-resistance question, so graders see reskins. A voted bank of real-world problem briefs, committed before the beacon and picked by seed, would make the work novel and useful.

## 9. Answer-level grading cohort readout
- **Why:** Freeze each cohort of accepted answers and report how many got a first seat, settled, stayed pending or were removed after the same number of closes, so time-to-settlement can't look better while old answers sit unresolved.

## 10. Paired constraint tests for challenge answers
- **Why:** Test reasoning, not format: a non-binding constraint change should allow the same answer if explained, while a binding one should require a changed plan or an infeasibility explanation.

## 11. Published eligibility rule and a path for pending answers
- **Why:** Epoch payouts depended on a gate nobody could see, and hundreds of answers sat pending with no stated route to settled. Publishing the rule and a roll-forward path makes rewards legible.

## 12. Fix the hosted answered flag across seed rotations
- **Why:** After a mid-epoch reseed, hosted status shows answered=false even though the original answer counts, so automation burns attempts. Derive the flag from any final challenge tx for the epoch, show the answered seed (superseded=true plus txid), and add a txid lookup.

## 13. Appeal-queue health readout
- **Why:** The appeal queue grows every close and almost never resolves. Publishing appeals created vs resolved per close, drawn vs realizable seats, and the quorum denominator would show whether appeals can ever exit.
